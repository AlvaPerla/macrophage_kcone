This repository contains the code used for my Master's thesis titled 'In Silico Study of Metabolic Changes in Macrophage Polarization'. 

It includes computational modeling of metabolic reprogramming during macrophage polarization, using metabolomics data to analyze the enzymatic activities in macrophages polarized under different stimuli. The model integrates data from various experimental conditions to characterize and compare the metabolic phenotypes of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages in contrast to resting macrophages (M0).

This code supports the analysis of changes in the central carbon metabolism pathways and aims to identify specific metabolic alterations linked to different polarization states, using a constraint-based model approach.
